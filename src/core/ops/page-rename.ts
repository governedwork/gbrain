The same transaction records the old slug as a slug alias (get_page on the old slug redirects and reports resolved_slug; [[old]] links keep resolving) and moves facts keyed to the old slug, fact withdrawals and frontmatter aliases (page_aliases) to the new slug. Textual [[wikilinks]] in other pages' bodies are NOT rewritten; they resolve through the alias. Rows that only store the slug as text (open loops, file records, take proposals) are not moved. Renames one page, not its children: rename each projects/x/* child with its own call. Database-canonical sources only: a source with a working tree (local_path, or sync.repo_path for default) is refused with source_writeback_required, because its file paths are its slugs; rename there with git mv, commit and sync. Read the page revision first and pass expected_revision; retain request_id for replay. Refuses with page_not_found when the page is missing or soft-deleted, slug_conflict when new_slug is held in that source by a live page, a soft-deleted page, or an alias to another page, and revision_conflict when the page changed. The committed receipt reports status renamed, slug (the new slug), renamed_from and the new revision.",
